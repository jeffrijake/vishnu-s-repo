What is docker storage drivers and Commands for view and manage the docker storage drivers?

Docker storage drivers are responsible for managing the storage of container images and container data on the Docker host. Docker supports various storage drivers, each with its own characteristics and performance characteristics. Here are some commonly used Docker storage drivers:

OverlayFS: OverlayFS is the default storage driver for most Linux distributions. It provides copy-on-write functionality and allows for efficient layering of container filesystems.

Device Mapper: Device Mapper uses thin provisioning and snapshotting to manage container storage. It's commonly used in environments where OverlayFS is not available or not suitable.

AUFS (Another Union File System): AUFS was one of the earliest storage drivers supported by Docker but has been deprecated in favor of OverlayFS.

Btrfs (B-tree file system): Btrfs is a modern filesystem with built-in support for features like snapshots, compression, and checksums. It can be used as a storage driver for Docker containers.

ZFS (Zettabyte File System): ZFS is a powerful filesystem with support for features like data integrity, compression, and snapshots. It can be used as a storage driver for Docker containers.

To view and manage the docker storage drivers the following commands will use in general :

docker info: Displays detailed information about Docker including the storage driver in use.

	docker info

docker system info: Provides more detailed information about Docker system, including storage driver details.

	docker system info

docker info --format '{{.Driver}}': Displays just the storage driver in use.

	docker info --format '{{.Driver}}'

docker image prune -a --filter "until=<duration>": Prunes unused images based on the storage driver's criteria.

	docker image prune -a --filter "until=24h"

docker container inspect --format='{{.GraphDriver.Name}}': Shows the storage driver used by a specific container.

	docker container inspect --format='{{.GraphDriver.Name}}' <container_id>

docker info --format '{{json .}}': Provides a detailed JSON output including storage driver information.

	docker info --format '{{json .}}'
