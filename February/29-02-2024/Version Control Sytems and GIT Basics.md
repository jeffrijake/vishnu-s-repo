Source Code Management:

What is Version Control System?

It is tool to help the team to manage and track the changes in the source code at any point of time. For Simple Understanding we can consider it as a database which it is a snapshot of the complete project. It is used for tracking the changes happen in any project code. It is not only used for tracking but also who made the change and why that change was made and where the change is happen and when the change was happen so like these ways version control system is helpful and also it will clearly differentiate the Before changes and after changes with that we can clearly understand the impact it is going to be happen in the code and lot and alsi by using this we can roll back to the previous version if any issue arise in the new version after changing the code.

Different types of Version Control System?

There are 2 types in this :

1) Centralized Version Control System  2)Distributed Version Control System.

What is Centralized Versioin Control System?

Centralized Version Control System is there will be one Central server(Repo) that will only maintain whole code related to that project whatever frontend code and backend code everything will store in that one centralized repo by doing like that there will be a chance of data loss and if due to whatever reason if that centralized repo crashes whole data related to that project will be loss it is big backdrop of this centralized version control system.
Example tool which is developed based on Centralized Version Control System is:

SVN (Subversion)

What is Distributed Version Control System?

This Distributed Version control system architecture is like There is one central repo and there is seperate seperate repos for every team like for operations team one local repo, for development team one local repo, for QA team one local repo like that the main code will store in the central repo whatever team want to do changes in their code they will clone the code from the central repo to their local repo there they will made the changes and again they will push it to the central repo again by doing like the code will stores in the central repo and also in the local repos by doing like that chances of data loss will be reduced so much and the performance, fastness and effectiveness will increased.
Example tool which is developed based on Distributed Version Control System is:

GIT.

GIT Basics and use of GIT?

-> First of all it is open source Fully Distributed Version Control System.

-> It is so speed to use and the GUI of the GIT is so understandable.

-> It is used mainly for **Parlle Development.

-> By using this Data Integrity and Data Security is very high.

-> It is using the SHA1 (Secured Hash Algorithm), By using this it will create check sums.

What is meant by Parllel Development?

Parllel Development means if we want to develop an Application, for that we need frontend developing team, backend developing team, testing team, QA team, operations and monitoring teams like that so in this parllel development that teams can start their respective works immediately no need to wait for complete the work by one team by using Branches Technique. It means in one repo there will be seperate seperate branches for their respective teams by this way we can deleiver work very fastly.

More about git will see tomorrow.
