What is continious integration?

It is one of the most important stage in devops, it is used to integrate every stage in devops. it will works in a way like if our code is in any remote repo platform this continious integration application work is to do autamatically it should fetch that code from that remote repo paltform and it should put that code for the trigger to build build means converting our code into the executable and then packaging the code as one executable package or one executable unit.

Workflow of the Continious Integration?

First developer will develop the source code and they will push or store in the remote repo then this continious integration tool automatically put that code for trigger to build once the build got success then it will automatically push that code for testing then if it pass all the testings then it will push to the Prod environment. In all these workflow whereever the code will fail again the process will start from the begining it is the workflow of continious integration.

For doing this continious integration there are so many tools but in all those Jenkins will be the best CI/CD tool to work.

Jenkins importance and benfits ?

- It is a open source application to use.
- In jenkins 2 versions one is Jenkins open source, it is a free version and second one is Cloudbees Jenkins, it is a paid version.
- 1900+ plugins available in jenkins these plugins is used for like to fetch the code in remote repo for that we will install that related plugin to do that action. like this for everything we can manage from the jenkins itself by installing and configuring that related plugin.
- Jenkins is developed / written in Java programming language.
- Jenkins is portable to all major platforms like Linux, Windows, MACOS, Docker container, Kuberenetes pods,etc,....
